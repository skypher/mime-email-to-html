    <dt>What is this site?</dt>
    <dd>This is a collection of messages by ancient Hermetic spirits. There are 360 spirits associated with the 360 degrees of the tropical zodiac, and 28 spirits associated with the lunar cycle.</dd>

    <dt>Where are these messages coming from?</dt>
    <dd>The spirits express themselves through Cynthia Schlosser. She reposts their messages according to the current position of the sun and moon, which means usually at least once per day. She posts them through Yahoo! Groups, which delivers it to one of my computers which collects and processes them into this site.</dd>

    <dt>Why did you build this site?</dt>
    <dd>The Yahoo! Group, while open to everyone, requires people to join. Furthermore, the content does not get picked up by search engines. And should Yahoo! ever go down, these messages might be lost. This site helps to make this valuable content available to a greater audience and serves as an archive.</dd>

    <dt>Is this stuff real? Are you crazy?</dt>
    <dd>Only you can decide.</dd>

    <dt>Where can I find more information on these spirits?</dt>
    <dd>Franz Bardon, The Practice of Magical Evocation. I can also teach you.</dd>

    <dt>Can I ask you something?</dt>
    <dd>Sure, send me an email at thesilverstarlight@fastmail.com</dd>

    <dt>Where can I find the current position of the sun and moon?</dt>
    <dd>Check out astro.com and lunarium.co.uk</dd>
